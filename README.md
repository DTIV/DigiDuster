DigiDuster **exchanges** unwanted **non performing tokens**, or tokens that can not be sold for lack of liquidity, **to** **DUST tokens** or partner tokens possibly. Users are incentivized by a multiplier on the DUST tokens they receive back, to guarantee greater value and a liquid token.

{% hint style="info" %}
DigiDuster gets swap amounts from OolongSwap Factory and Router contracts and is only accurate on Mainnet-Boba or a Fork on Localhost currently.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
